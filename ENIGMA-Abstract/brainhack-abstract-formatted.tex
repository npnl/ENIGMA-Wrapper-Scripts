\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

A vast number of clinical disorders may involve changes in brain
structure that are correlated with cognitive function and behavior
(e.g., depression, schizophrenia, stroke, etc.). Reliably understanding
the relationship between specific brain structures and relevant
behaviors in worldwide clinical populations could dramatically improve
healthcare decisions around the world. For instance, if a reliable
relationship between brain structure after stroke and functional motor
ability was established, brain imaging could be used to predict
prognosis/recovery potential for individual patients. However, high
heterogeneity in clinical populations in both individual neuroanatomy
and behavioral outcomes make it difficult to develop accurate models of
these potentially subtle relationships.

Large neuroimaging studies (n\textgreater{}10,000) would provide
unprecedented power to successfully relate clinical neuroanatomy changes
with behavioral measures. While these sample sizes might be difficult
for any one individual to collect, the ENIGMA Center for Worldwide
Medicine, Imaging, and Genomics has successfully pioneered meta- and
mega-analytic methods to accomplish this task. ENIGMA brings together a
global alliance of over 500 international researchers from over 35
countries to pool together neuroimaging data on different disease states
in hopes of discovering critical brain-behavior relationships
(http://enigma.ini.usc.edu; Thompson et al., 2015, Hibar et al., 2015). Individual
investigators with relevant data run ENIGMA analysis protocols on their
own data and send back an output folder containing the analysis results
to be combined with data from other sites for a meta-analysis. In this
way, large sample sizes can be acquired without the hassle of
large-scale data transfers or actual neuroimaging data sharing.

ENIGMA protocols were initially developed to harmonize processing
methods of imaging researchers around the world and they require a
moderate level of familiarity with several programming languages and
environments. However, ENIGMA's recent success has attracted greater
interest in collaborative neuroimaging and protocols must be adjusted to
allow for all levels of experience, as, the success of this approach
depends on individual collaborators running these ENIGMA protocols on
their data. Here, we worked on simplifying these protocols so even a
novice programmer could use them. In this way, we hope to expand the
feasibility of collecting critical clinical data from collaborators who
may have less experience with neuroimaging techniques.

\section{Approach}\label{approach}

The current ENIGMA protocols \url{(http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/protocols/)} for
structural neuroimaging analyses consist of a number of different word
documents with embedded links to different scripts and snippets of code
that use R, bash scripting, Matlab, FSL, and Freesurfer. Each step must
be run sequentially, costing the user time during the implementation to
wait for each step to finish before beginning the next. In addition, the
number of different scripts, programming languages and software
environments can be challenging for a novice user and introduces
numerous instances where the individual may make errors in implementing
the code. To address this, we created 3 easy-to-use wrapper scripts
that automate the implementation of the ENIGMA protocols for both
subcortical and cortical structural MRI analyses. These wrapper scripts
reduce over 40 steps down to 3 quick steps for the user. We also created
a user-friendly readme file that includes screenshots of the code
implementation.

To examine the ease of use and time to implement the new scripts, we
tested each of them on 7 users who had different levels of familiarity
with programming and neuroimaging (novice users (no programming
experience), moderate users (basic-to-intermediate programming
experience), and expert users (extensive programming)). To explore
additional factors relating to implementation, two of the expert users
had to use the scripts in a different environment (e.g., organize the
data, install the software, etc.).

\section{Results/Discussion}\label{resultsdiscussion}

Overall, moderate and expert level users found the scripts extremely
easy to implement and required less than 25 minutes to get all three
scripts running (excluding the run time of each script; see Table 1 for
individual results). The two novice users required greater support to
understand basic elements (e.g., what is a terminal), but with support,
were able to complete all the steps in less than 1 hour. Finally, the expert users who implemented the scripts on their own environment found the most time-consuming steps to be installing and troubleshooting Freesurfer (e.g., install errors; troubleshooting a conflict between the preset Freesurfer subjects directory and the output directory required by the scripts) and reorganizing data into a format for the scripts (e.g., putting the data into an organized format with main_folder/subject_folder/subject.nii.gz). Once these steps were complete, each expert user reported about 10 minutes for script implementation.

The wrapper scripts made the implementation of the ENIGMA protocols
quick and feasible even for novice users. However, there were still
three main barriers to participation that required significant time,
computational resources, and some expertise: 1) data organization
(depending on previous data structure), 2) running freesurfer
(\textasciitilde{}12 hrs/subj), and 3) installation of the required
software (e.g., Freesurfer, FSL, R). Future projects may look at ways to
streamline these areas for a more seamless user experience in order to
facilitate greater sharing of clinical neuroimaging data through ENIGMA.
